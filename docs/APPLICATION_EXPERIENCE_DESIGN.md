# Application Experience Design

## Epic 1: First Meeting (Onboarding Journey)

### The Experience Vision
The first interaction should feel like meeting a wise, non-judgmental friend who's genuinely curious about you, not a medical professional with a clipboard. No forms, no requirements, just a gentle conversation.

### User Story 1.1: The Welcome
**As a** new user opening the app for the first time  
**I want to** feel immediately accepted wherever I am in my health journey  
**So that** I don't feel judged or overwhelmed before even starting  

**Experience Design:**
- Soft, calming visual design - think morning light, not clinical white
- First screen shows only: "Before we start, I want you to know something: wherever you are right now is okay. We're not here to fix you. We're here to understand you."
- Single button: "Let's talk" (not "Get Started" or "Sign Up")
- No logo splash screens, no feature tours, no selling

### User Story 1.2: The First Question
**As a** new user  
**I want to** share why I'm here in my own words  
**So that** the app understands my emotional starting point  

**Experience Design:**
- "What brought you here today?" with options that acknowledge real feelings:
  - "Curiosity about my patterns"
  - "Hope that something could change"  
  - "Honestly? Desperation"
  - "Someone suggested I try this"
  - "I don't really know"
  - "Something else..." (free text option)
- Each choice leads to slightly different response acknowledging that feeling
- No "wrong" answers, no judgment

### User Story 1.3: The Struggle Acknowledgment
**As a** new user  
**I want to** have my struggles recognized without having to explain everything  
**So that** I feel understood, not interrogated  

**Experience Design:**
- "What's feeling hard right now?" with realistic options:
  - "Everything feels overwhelming"
  - "I'm tired all the time"
  - "I can't seem to change no matter what I try"
  - "I don't know where to start"
  - "I've tried everything and nothing works"
  - "Actually, I'm doing okay, just curious"
- Response adapts to selection: overwhelming gets "That's really hard. Let's take this slowly." Curious gets "Great place to be. Let's explore together."

### User Story 1.4: The First Invitation
**As a** new user  
**I want to** start with something tiny and non-threatening  
**So that** I don't feel pressured to change everything immediately  

**Experience Design:**
- "Here's all I'm going to ask of you: Would you be willing to just notice one thing about how you feel tomorrow morning? Not change anything. Not report back. Just notice."
- Options: "I can do that" / "Tell me more" / "Even that feels hard right now"
- If "even that feels hard": "That's okay. Sometimes just downloading this app is enough for today. I'll be here when you're ready."

### User Story 1.5: Optional Information
**As a** new user  
**I want to** share only what I'm comfortable sharing  
**So that** I maintain control over my privacy and pace  

**Experience Design:**
- "I can work with whatever you're comfortable sharing. The more I understand about your patterns, the more helpful I can be, but we can discover things together over time."
- Visual cards that can be flipped to reveal/input:
  - Basic patterns (morning person? evening person?)
  - Energy levels (generally high/medium/low/varies)
  - What you're curious about (sleep, energy, mood, eating, movement, stress)
- Each card clearly marked "Optional" with skip always available
- No weight, measurements, or medical history required

## Epic 2: Daily Rhythm (Core Engagement)

### User Story 2.1: The Adaptive Check-in
**As a** returning user  
**I want** the app to match my energy level  
**So that** it doesn't demand more than I have to give  

**Experience Design:**
- Morning notification (if enabled): Gentle, not pushy: "Morning. How's your energy today?"
- Single-tap response: üòä Great / üôÇ Good / üòê Okay / üòî Rough / üò´ Terrible
- Interface adapts immediately:
  - Great/Good: Shows more options, patterns noticed, possible experiments
  - Okay: Balanced interface, gentle observations
  - Rough/Terrible: Minimalist interface, just support: "Rough days are data too. Just existing is enough today."

### User Story 2.2: Pattern Reflections
**As a** regular user  
**I want** to see patterns I might not notice myself  
**So that** I gain insight without analysis paralysis  

**Experience Design:**
- Subtle pattern cards appear based on data: "I noticed something interesting..."
- Visual pattern representation (not graphs): 
  - Tuesday energy tends to dip (shown as gentle wave)
  - Sleep before midnight ‚Üí better mornings (shown as moon/sun correlation)
  - That Thursday meeting ‚Üí stress eating (shown as connected dots)
- Always framed as observations: "Just something I noticed. Curious what you think?"
- Can dismiss without consequence

### User Story 2.3: Micro-Experiments
**As a** user ready for small changes  
**I want** to try tiny experiments based on my patterns  
**So that** I learn what works without overwhelming commitment  

**Experience Design:**
- After pattern establishment, gentle offer: "Want to experiment with something?"
- Tiny, specific experiments:
  - "Try having protein at breakfast for 3 days and see if afternoon energy changes"
  - "What if you took 3 deep breaths before that Thursday meeting?"
  - "Curious what happens if you walk around the block when you feel that 3pm slump"
- Built-in check-back: "How did that experiment go?" with options:
  - "Helped!" ‚Üí "Great! Want to keep going with it?"
  - "No difference" ‚Üí "Good to know. That's valuable data."
  - "Made things worse" ‚Üí "Really good to know. Let's not do that again."
  - "Forgot to try" ‚Üí "No worries. Want to try again or skip it?"

## Epic 3: Pattern Recognition & Insights

### User Story 3.1: The Living Pattern Map
**As a** user with accumulated data  
**I want** to see how my patterns connect  
**So that** I understand my personal system  

**Experience Design:**
- Visual pattern map (not charts/graphs) showing connections:
  - Sleep affects ‚Üí mood affects ‚Üí eating affects ‚Üí energy
  - Stress triggers ‚Üí comfort behaviors ‚Üí recovery patterns
- Interactive: tap a node to see specific examples from your data
- Evolves over time, showing strengthening/weakening patterns
- Can annotate: "This makes sense because..."

### User Story 3.2: Predictive Support
**As a** user with established patterns  
**I want** proactive support for challenging situations  
**So that** I'm prepared, not reactive  

**Experience Design:**
- Gentle predictions based on patterns: "Tomorrow might be challenging based on your sleep this week. Want to plan some support?"
- Contextual awareness: "I see you have that Thursday meeting tomorrow. Remember what helped last time?"
- Prep options offered:
  - "Set a reminder to breathe"
  - "Plan an easier lunch"
  - "Schedule a walk after"
  - "Just knowing helps"

## Epic 4: Crisis & Recovery Support

### User Story 4.1: Crisis Detection
**As a** user in crisis  
**I want** the app to recognize and adapt  
**So that** I'm not overwhelmed when I'm already struggling  

**Experience Design:**
- Automatic detection through:
  - Sudden disengagement
  - Mood pattern changes
  - Keywords in any text input
  - Dramatic behavior shifts
- Immediate interface simplification
- Crisis mode activation (no explicit announcement, just adaptation)

### User Story 4.2: Crisis Mode
**As a** user in crisis  
**I want** minimal, essential support  
**So that** I have an anchor without pressure  

**Experience Design:**
- Everything disappears except: "I can see things are really hard right now. I'm here if you need me."
- Four simple options:
  - ü´Å "Just remind me to breathe"
  - üíß "Help me remember water"
  - üëã "Check on me once a day"
  - ü§´ "Stay quiet but here"
- If critical patterns detected: "Sometimes we need more support than any app can provide. Here are some resources if you need them." (Localized crisis resources)

### User Story 4.3: Return Without Shame
**As a** user returning after absence  
**I want** to be welcomed without judgment  
**So that** I don't avoid the app from shame  

**Experience Design:**
- Return message: "Hey there. Good to see you."
- Two options only:
  - "Want to catch up?" ‚Üí gentle questions about the gap
  - "Fresh start?" ‚Üí everything resets to today
- No mention of:
  - Lost streaks
  - Reversed progress
  - Time away
  - Previous goals

## Epic 5: Community & Shared Wisdom

### User Story 5.1: Pattern Tribes
**As a** user with identified patterns  
**I want** to connect with others who share them  
**So that** I feel less alone  

**Experience Design:**
- Invitation only after patterns established: "Others have similar Tuesday energy dips. Want to see what helps them?"
- Pattern-based groups, not demographic:
  - "Sunday Scaries Crew"
  - "3pm Energy Crash Club"
  - "Stress Eating After Meetings Gang"
- Anonymous by default, can choose to share identity
- No comparison, no competition, just shared experience

### User Story 5.2: Wisdom Exchange
**As a** user who found something that works  
**I want** to help others with similar patterns  
**So that** my experience has meaning  

**Experience Design:**
- Prompt after successful experiment: "This seemed to help you. Would you like to share it with others who have similar patterns?"
- Shared as: "Someone with your pattern found this helpful..."
- Recognition without identification: "Your suggestion helped 3 people this week. Thank you."
- Can see anonymized outcomes: "2 people tried your suggestion: 1 found it helpful, 1 is still experimenting"

## Epic 6: Evolution & Independence

### User Story 6.1: Growing Awareness
**As a** long-term user  
**I want** to see my growth in awareness  
**So that** I recognize my progress  

**Experience Design:**
- Awareness markers (not achievements):
  - "You're noticing patterns before I point them out"
  - "You're creating your own experiments"
  - "Your observation notes are becoming more detailed"
  - "You're recovering from setbacks faster"
- Visual evolution of your pattern map showing increased connections and understanding
- Shift in app language from teaching to reflecting

### User Story 6.2: Graduated Independence
**As a** user who has developed strong awareness  
**I want** the app to recognize my growth  
**So that** I'm encouraged toward independence  

**Experience Design:**
- App gradually suggests less frequent check-ins: "You seem to have a good rhythm. Want to try checking in weekly instead of daily?"
- Shift from suggestions to confirmations: "You already knew to take that walk, didn't you?"
- Eventually: "You've developed such strong awareness. I'm here if you need me, but you might not need to check in as often."
- Final stage option: "Archive mode" - app becomes a reference library of your patterns, available but not active

- "I noticed..." not "You should..."
- "Curious..." not "You need to..."
- Always maintaining user agency

### Interaction Design:
- Every screen has an escape hatch
- Nothing is ever required
- Can always skip, dismiss, or say "not now"
- Complexity reveals gradually based on capacity
- Undo/change mind always available
- **Cross-Platform Consistency:** Same gentle experience on mobile, tablet, desktop
- **HTMX Interactions:** Smooth, app-like responses without page refreshes
- **Offline Graceful:** Core features work offline, sync when reconnected

### Data Visualization:
- Patterns, not performance
- Connections, not comparisons
- Evolution, not evaluation
- Stories, not statistics
- Personal, not population-based

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Responsive Breakpoints:
- **Mobile First:** 320px-768px (primary focus)
- **Tablet:** 768px-1024px (optimized touch interactions)
- **Desktop:** 1024px+ (enhanced with keyboard shortcuts, hover states)

### HTMX 2 Integration:
- **Adaptive Interface:** `hx-get="/interface/{capacity}"` swaps entire interface based on user state
- **Pattern Cards:** `hx-trigger="load delay:2s"` for gentle, timed appearances
- **Crisis Mode:** `hx-boost="false"` ensures immediate local responses
- **Progressive Enhancement:** All features work without JavaScript, enhanced with HTMX

### PWA Features:
- **Installable:** Web app manifest enables "Add to Home Screen"
- **Offline Core:** Service worker caches essential crisis support features
- **Push Notifications:** Gentle morning check-ins (where supported)
- **Background Sync:** Pattern data syncs when connection restored

This design creates an experience that feels like having a wise, patient, non-judgmental friend who helps you understand yourself better, supports you through difficulties, and gradually helps you become your own expert - ultimately making themselves unnecessary. The web-first approach ensures this experience is available to everyone, regardless of device or platform preference.
