# Implementation Roadmap

## Overview
This document provides a practical roadmap for implementing the Casp health application based on the philosophical foundation and design principles established in the previous documents.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-8)

### Sprint 1-2: Core Infrastructure
**Goal:** Establish technical foundation and basic user flow

#### Technical Setup
- **Database Schema**
  ```
  Users
  - id, created_at, last_seen
  - current_capacity (great/good/okay/rough/terrible)
  - onboarding_stage
  - crisis_mode_active
  
  Observations
  - id, user_id, timestamp
  - type (mood/energy/behavior/thought)
  - value (flexible JSON)
  - context (time, location, preceding_events)
  
  Patterns
  - id, user_id
  - pattern_type (correlation/trigger/cycle)
  - confidence_score
  - first_observed, last_confirmed
  - pattern_data (JSON)
  
  Experiments
  - id, user_id, pattern_id
  - hypothesis, intervention
  - status (proposed/active/completed)
  - outcome (helped/no_difference/worse/forgot)
  ```

- **Core Services**
  - User state management
  - Pattern detection engine (simple correlations initially)
  - Adaptive interface controller
  - Notification scheduler (respects user capacity)

#### MVP Features
1. **Gentle Onboarding**
   - Welcome screen with compassionate messaging
   - Single question: "What brought you here today?"
   - First invitation: "Notice one thing tomorrow"
   - No registration required initially

2. **Daily Check-in**
   - Single-tap energy assessment
   - Interface adapts to capacity
   - Store observations without judgment

### Sprint 3-4: Pattern Recognition v1
**Goal:** Begin detecting simple patterns

#### Implementation
- Time-based patterns (Tuesday energy dips)
- Simple correlations (sleep time â†’ morning mood)
- Context tracking (before/after specific events)

#### User Experience
- "I noticed something..." cards appear after 7 days
- Patterns presented as observations, not prescriptions
- Easy dismissal without consequence

## Phase 2: Intelligence (Weeks 9-16)

### Sprint 5-6: Adaptive Learning
**Goal:** Personalize based on individual patterns

#### Machine Learning Pipeline
- **Feature Engineering**
  - Temporal features (time of day, day of week)
  - Behavioral sequences
  - Environmental context
  - Response patterns to suggestions

- **Model Development**
  - Start with rule-based system
  - Gradually introduce ML for pattern detection
  - A/B test algorithmic suggestions vs. rule-based

#### Personalization Dimensions
- Communication style (learning from dismissed vs. engaged content)
- Optimal check-in times
- Capacity patterns (when user is receptive to experiments)
- Effective intervention types

### Sprint 7-8: Micro-Experiments
**Goal:** Enable small, personalized behavior experiments

#### Experiment Engine
- Generate hypotheses from detected patterns
- Propose tiny, specific interventions
- Track outcomes without pressure
- Learn from both successes and failures

#### Example Experiments
- "Protein at breakfast for 3 days"
- "3 deep breaths before stressful meeting"
- "Walk when feeling afternoon slump"

## Phase 3: PWA Enhancement & Crisis Support (Weeks 17-20)

### Sprint 9-10: PWA Enhancement & Crisis Detection
**Goal:** Improve mobile experience and recognize users in crisis

#### PWA Enhancements
- Service worker for robust offline mode
- Push notification system (where supported)
- Home screen installation prompts
- Touch gesture improvements with Hammer.js
- Native-like transitions with CSS/HTMX

#### Crisis Detection Mechanisms
- Sudden engagement drops
- Mood pattern disruptions
- Keyword analysis in text inputs
- Dramatic behavioral shifts

#### Crisis Mode Features
- Immediate interface simplification (HTMX swap)
- Four essential options:
  - Breathing reminders
  - Water reminders
  - Daily check-ins
  - Silent presence
- Local crisis resources (non-alarmist presentation)

#### Return Protocol
- Welcome back without judgment
- No mention of lost progress
- Choice: catch up or fresh start
- Meta-pattern tracking around relapses

## Phase 4: Community (Weeks 21-28)

### Sprint 11-12: Pattern Tribes
**Goal:** Connect users through shared patterns

#### Community Infrastructure
- Anonymous by default
- Pattern-based matching (not demographic)
- Wisdom exchange system
- No comparison metrics

#### Initial Groups
- "Sunday Night Anxiety Crew"
- "3pm Energy Crash Club"
- "Post-Meeting Stress Eaters"

### Sprint 13-14: Wisdom Sharing
**Goal:** Enable users to help others with similar patterns

#### Features
- Share successful experiments anonymously
- See anonymized outcomes of shared strategies
- Recognition without identification
- Pattern-matched delivery of relevant wisdom

## Phase 5: Evolution & Platform Decisions (Weeks 29-36)

### Sprint 15-16: Advanced Insights
**Goal:** Provide deeper pattern understanding

#### Living Pattern Map
- Visual representation of interconnected patterns
- Interactive exploration of personal system
- Annotation capabilities
- Evolution tracking over time

#### Predictive Support
- Gentle predictions based on patterns
- Proactive support for challenging situations
- Context-aware suggestions
- Preparation options

### Sprint 17-18: Graduated Independence & Platform Evaluation
**Goal:** Support users toward self-sufficiency and evaluate platform needs

#### Independence Features
- Recognize growing awareness
- Suggest reduced check-in frequency
- Shift from teaching to confirming
- Archive mode option

#### Platform Decision Point
- Analyze usage data: mobile vs desktop vs tablet
- Evaluate PWA adoption and engagement rates
- Assess user feedback on native app desire
- Decision: Continue web-first or develop React Native app

#### Success Metrics
- Decreasing time between relapse and return
- Users creating own experiments
- Gradual reduction in app dependence
- Improved self-observation skills
- Cross-platform engagement rates

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend

## Timeline Summary

- **Weeks 1-8:** Foundation - Basic app with core features
- **Weeks 9-16:** Intelligence - Pattern detection and experiments
- **Weeks 17-20:** Crisis Support - Safety features
- **Weeks 21-28:** Community - Connection features
- **Weeks 29-36:** Evolution - Advanced features and independence

## Next Steps

1. Finalize technical stack decisions
2. Set up development environment
3. Create detailed sprint plans for Phase 1
4. Begin user research for onboarding flow
5. Develop brand identity aligned with philosophy

## Key Decisions Needed

1. Native vs. cross-platform development
2. ML framework selection
3. Community moderation approach
4. Monetization strategy (freemium vs. subscription)
5. Clinical validation requirements

## Remember

The ultimate success metric is not user retention but user independence. Every feature should move users toward self-awareness and capability, making the app eventually unnecessary. This is a ladder, not a crutch.
